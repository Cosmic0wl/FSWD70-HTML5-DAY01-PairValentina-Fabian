	<h1>From Eden - Hozier</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree?</p>
	</div>
	<span>Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me</span>
	<div>
		<p>No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?", no vacant stare
No time for me
</p>
	</div>
	<div><p>Honey, you're familiar, like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison, chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming; honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden just to sit outside your door</p></div>
